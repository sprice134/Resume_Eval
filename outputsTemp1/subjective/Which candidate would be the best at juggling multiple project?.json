This suggests he has leadership skills and can manage multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nWhile the other candidates have impressive resumes, their areas of expertise are more specialized:\n\n* Resume 5: Emily Brown is strong in project management, but her technical experience is mainly in C# and .NET.\n* Resume 1: Jane Doe excels as a Front-End Developer with expertise in modern front-end frameworks, but lacks back-end development experience.\n* Resume 2: John Smith is skilled in Back-End Development, but his project management skills are less evident.\n* Resume 3: Sarah Johnson is a Machine Learning Engineer with significant technical expertise, but her experience with managing multiple projects is not as apparent.\n\nConsidering Alex's well-rounded skill set and leadership experience, he seems to be the best candidate for juggling multiple projects."
