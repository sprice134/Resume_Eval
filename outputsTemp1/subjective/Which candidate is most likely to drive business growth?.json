Here's why:\n\n1. She has experience leading teams and managing projects, which suggests she can manage complex technical projects.\n2. Her background in project management and business analysis indicates she understands how technology can support business goals.\n3. She has a strong understanding of languages like C# and .NET, which are commonly used for enterprise-level applications.\n\nWhile Sarah Johnson's experience with machine learning is impressive, her focus on data science and model deployment might not be as directly related to driving business growth in the same way Emily Brown's project management and technical expertise are."
