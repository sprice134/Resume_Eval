For example, John Smith's (Resume 2) experience is mostly in back-end development, while Jane Doe's (Resume 1) experience is mostly in front-end development. Emily Brown's (Resume 5) experience is more focused on software engineering and project management, but her background doesn't suggest she has expertise in machine learning or data-driven business growth.
