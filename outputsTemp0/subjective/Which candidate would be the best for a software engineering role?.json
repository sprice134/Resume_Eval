Both candidates have:\n\n* 5 years of experience in software development\n* Strong proficiency in relevant programming languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS) and frameworks/libraries (React, Node.js, Express)\n* Experience with front-end and back-end development\n* Good understanding of DevOps practices (CI/CD, AWS, Docker)\n\nHowever, if I had to choose one, I would recommend **Resume 4: Alex Williams**. Here's why:\n\n* Alex has experience in both front-end and back-end development, making them a more versatile candidate.\n* They have worked on cloud infrastructure management using AWS, which is a valuable skill for any software engineer.\n* Their experience with CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker demonstrates their understanding of DevOps practices.\n* Alex's education background (B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Washington) suggests they have a solid foundation in computer science principles.\n\nWhile Jane Doe has impressive front-end development skills, her experience is more focused on that area, and I'm not sure if she would be as comfortable with back-end development or DevOps practices."
