However, Resume 3 (Sarah Johnson) has an M.S. in Computer Science (Specialization in AI/ML), which might give her an edge in machine learning-related roles or projects.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would say that **Resume 4: Alex Williams** is the best candidate overall. Here's why:\n\n* Strong technical expertise in Full-Stack Development.\n* Demonstrated ability to work collaboratively and effectively with cross-functional teams.\n* Relevant experience with popular technologies (React, Node.js, AWS) and tools (Docker, Jenkins).\n* Education from a reputable university (University of Washington).\n\nWhile all candidates have their strengths, Resume 4 presents the most comprehensive profile of technical expertise, collaboration skills, and relevant experience."
